# EXPERIMENT-3  
# AIM:
To demonstrate the usage of arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators in C++.



# THEORY:
In programming languages, operators are represented by symbols that specify the operations performed on operands. In the context of C++, operators are extensively utilized to execute a wide array of operations on variables and values.

 


# CONCLUSION: 
The code demonstrates using arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators in C++, showcasing their functions and implementation. Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations, assignment operators modify variable values, and comparison operators aid in decision-making by comparing values.
